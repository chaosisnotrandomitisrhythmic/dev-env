# Ansible vault for secrets. Encrypts SSH keys, creds, and other sensitive bits.
# Keep vault password in a secure place, never in git.
# 
# Usage:
# ansible-vault create/edit group_vars/all/vault.yml
# ansible-playbook --ask-vault-pass playbook.yml

# The Ansible Vault approach provides:
# - Encrypted storage of sensitive data
# - Version control friendly
# - Role-based access control
# - Automated secret management
# - Secure distribution of credentials

# Key components:
# 1. Encrypted vault files for different environments
# 2. Secure key management
# 3. Automated decryption during playbook execution
# 4. Proper access controls and audit trails

# Best practices implemented:
# - Separate vault files per environment
# - Regular vault password rotation
# - Limited access to vault passwords
# - Automated deployment with CI/CD integration
# - Secure backup of vault files

# Note: Always keep the vault password secure and never commit it to version control
